Today we are going to make a oreo biscuits chocolate cake...
First we need to have some crushed pieces of oreo biscuits. We will add some milk into it. We will strir it till we get a liquidy batter and we'll add sugar carefully as biscuits are already sweet. Now we are going to add baking soda (1/4th of spoon) and baking powder (1/4th of spoon). You can add melted chocolate according to ur taste. If you are ready to bake it, then add a sachet of eno into it so that the cake would get fluffy. And then at the end, we will take a bowl and grease it well with oil. We can even keep butter paper in the bowl if we want. Now pour the mixture in that bowl and then keep it in oven to bake it for 6-7 minutes. Now your cake is ready...
